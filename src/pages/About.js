                        A young software enthusiast who is eager to learn and go above and beyond to solve any problems, with my technical and soft skills, I am well capable of facing any challenges.

                        I can say I have the ability to be adaptable, compassionate and open-minded. From my experience with owning my own business I have gained the ability to be disciplined, reliable and patient, which are skills that are vital to be successful in the tech industry.
